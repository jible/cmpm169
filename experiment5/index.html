				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					At the begining of this project, I set out to "fumble around and try to make a 3D engine."
					I'd say I did pretty good. This is more of a 3D renderer than a 3D engine, but I'm proud of what I made in a week.
					I pretty closely followed this tutorial	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU&ab_channel=javidx9">video</a>.
					I managed to rendere a cube and translate it around the 3D space.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					I made a 3D cube, made of triangles, that are made of 3 Vector3s each. I made a projection matrix
					that you multiiply each Vector3 by to find where they would reside in a 2D screen. The projection matrix
					considers the aspect ratio, angle/field of vision, and aspects of the 3D world. Using the 2D points acquired with the projection matrix,
					I drew lines connecting the points of each triangle, which created angled surfaces that emulate a 3D space.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					The hardest part of this project was understanding the math, but the video was super thorough and explained it well. I encountered a few small issues setting up the cube point vectors. There were 
					so many, it was hard to keep track and write them all correctly. But once the cube rendered, I knew what was wrong and fixed it pretty quickly.
