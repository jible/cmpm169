				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					I improved upon a project that I worked on over Winter break. This is a pixelation tool that scaled down images and applies a palette to them.
					I noticed that it was running pretty slowly, so I added a new palette applying feature that would compute faster. It is called "lazy" cause its a lazy calculation for what color to use.

					Then, I added an export button that allows you to download the image you created.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					This tool uses html canvases to read an input image and modify it. It reads the pixels and puts them into blocks of colors. It then finds the closest color from the palette to the block's determined color.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This was a nice oppurtunity to improve upon this project. It was also nice being able to focus on taking one aspect from another project and modifying that aspect of something I have already worked on. It made this feel
					slightly more original. Additionally, I kept my code in the last project very clean, so it was easy to add new buttons and calculations.
